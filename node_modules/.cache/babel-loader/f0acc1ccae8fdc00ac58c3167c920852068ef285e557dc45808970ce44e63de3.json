Methodology\\n\\nBenchmarking: 5 competitor analyses informed patterns (e.g., status tracking).\\n\\nStakeholder Notes: \\nParsed conversations with Stakeholders: Business (Finance) & Product Owner to flag ambiguities, validate all requirements, api usages, previous experience with current app.\\nMapped actions per user type.\\nHighlighted friction in provider/finance handoffs\\nCollaboration: Bridged gaps between devs and Product Owner to fit time requirements, technology capabilities, best methodology, solve all questions that could have remained.\\nHeuristic Review: Highlighted navigation issues (breadcrumbs), consistency (language), feedback loops (notifications) new Material Receipts hierachy requirements.

Project Overview\\n\\nGoals:\\nDevelop a culturally-sensitive mobile application that addresses the unique sleep challenges faced by Colombian women, incorporating local cultural factors, socioeconomic considerations, and behavioral patterns that affect sleep quality.\\n\\nRole: UX Researcher & Designer (conducted extensive user research, cultural analysis, and designed the complete user experience).\\n\\n2. Research Methodology\\n\\nUser Research: Conducted in-depth interviews with 200 Colombian women across different age groups, socioeconomic backgrounds, and geographic regions to understand their sleep patterns, challenges, and cultural factors affecting their rest.\\n\\nCultural Analysis: Studied Colombian cultural norms, family dynamics, work patterns, and social expectations that impact women's sleep schedules and quality.\\n\\nBehavioral Mapping: Analyzed daily routines, stress factors, and environmental conditions that contribute to sleep disruption among Colombian women.\\n\\n3. Key Findings & Insights\\n\\nCultural Factors: Extended family responsibilities and traditional gender roles often prioritize others' needs over personal sleep health.\\nEnvironmental Challenges: Urban noise, housing conditions, and climate factors significantly impact sleep quality.\\nSocioeconomic Impact: Work schedules, multiple job responsibilities, and financial stress create irregular sleep patterns.\\nTechnology Adoption: High smartphone usage but limited exposure to sleep wellness apps designed for Latin American contexts.\\n\\n4. Design Solution\\n\\nCulturally-Adapted Interface: Designed with Colombian cultural context in mind, using familiar language patterns, imagery, and interaction models.\\nPersonalized Sleep Plans: Created adaptive recommendations based on individual circumstances, family responsibilities, and work schedules.\\nCommunity Features: Integrated social support elements that align with Colombian women's preference for community-based wellness approaches.\\nPractical Tools: Included features for managing family schedules, stress reduction techniques adapted for Colombian contexts, and environmental optimization tips.\\n\\n5. Impact & Results\\n\\nUser Engagement: High adoption rates among test users, with 85% reporting improved sleep awareness.\\nCultural Relevance: Positive feedback on culturally-sensitive design elements and locally-relevant content.\\nBehavioral Change: 70% of users reported implementing at least 3 recommended sleep hygiene practices.\\nCommunity Building: Strong user engagement with peer support and community features.\",mainImages:[\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/a3ba60151173877.6307339ab5301.png\",\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/93cbe4151173877.6307339ab1eb9.png\",\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/a09118151173877.6307339ab83c7.png\",\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/e19cf1151173877.6307339ab159e.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/4a62e3151173877.6307339ab5b6a.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/664a5d151173877.6307339ab6bd0.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/e880e5151173877.6307339ab73ef.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/55d557151173877.6307339ab41c3.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/71eebd151173877.6307339ab4a78.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/1be89c151173877.6307339ab2fe9.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/3efc53151173877.6307339ab2771.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/f5b195151173877.6307339aafc7c.png\",\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/c8fc04151173877.6307339aaf399.png\",\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/9437bb151173877.6307339ab7bee.png\",\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/163d6a151173877.6307339ab0d6c.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/cadabc151173877.6307339ab387a.png\",//\n\"/assets/img/portfolio/together/59d244151173877.6307339ab0507.png\"//\n],thumbnailImages:[//

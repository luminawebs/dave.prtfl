Project Overview\n\nGoals: \nStreamline MR workflows across Field Engineers \u2192 Providers \u2192 Finance while ensuring audit trails from Finance Team and compliance for internal Company teams.\nFinance needed better tools to validate MRs (approved/rejected) before payment.\n\nRole: UX Validator/Analyst (identified gaps via stakeholder notes and heuristic evaluation).\n\n2. Methodology\n\nBenchmarking: 5 competitor analyses informed patterns (e.g., status tracking).\n\nStakeholder Notes: \nParsed conversations with Stakeholders: Business (Finance) & Product Owner to flag ambiguities, validate all requirements, api usages, previous experience with current app.\nMapped actions per user type.\nHighlighted friction in provider/finance handoffs\nCollaboration: Bridged gaps between devs and Product Owner to fit time requirements, technology capabilities, best methodology, solve all questions that could have remained.\nHeuristic Review: Highlighted navigation issues (breadcrumbs), consistency (language), feedback loops (notifications) new Material Receipts hierachy requirements. MR for each Proyect, Well & Stage.\nFindings & Key Improvements Proposed\n\nLanguage: Mixed Spanish/English terms caused confusion (e.g., "Proveedor" vs. "Provider").\nNavigation: Missing "Go back" buttons disrupted multi-step workflows \nUnexistent breadcrumbs to Well selection screens.\nRedesign status indicators (progress percentages avoided because of time dev constrains)\nUser Flow: Map MR lifecycle (creation \u2192 approval \u2192 closure) with notification touchpoints.\nThe solution\n3. UI/UX Improvements\nDashboard required to be Role-Specific\nClearer role-based UI paths (e.g., hyperlinked breadcrumbs for Wells).\nField Engineers: Quick MR PDF generation with pre-filled forms.\nFinance: MR validation panel with fast search options.\nReduced manual errors in MR handoffs (Finance could trace MRs to Providers).\nConfirmation Alerts: Notify Providers upon MR acceptance by Finance.\n(mail whole team)\n\nBackend Logic\n\nAuto-remove Providers post-payment (flagged as a requirement).\nDual-signature enforcement in PDF MRs (automated by active user).\n\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nHolistic View: Ties UI improvements (e.g., breadcrumbs) to user roles (e.g., Finance needs quick access).\nBusiness Impact: Shows how UX reduces workflow bottlenecks (e.g., payment delays).\nMantain UI Business related Brand and Lookn\u2019Feel',mainImages:["/assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/02-finished/Home-documentation.png","/assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/02-finished/mr-new-flow.png","/assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/02-finished/end-img.png"],thumbnailImages:["assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/01-process/new-flow.png","assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/01-process/old-flow.png","assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/01-process/actions-by-user.png","assets/img/portfolio/material-receipt/01-process/users-access.png"],techStack:["Figma","Design Thinking","UI/UX","Scrum"],accordion:[],features:["Role-Based Dashboard","Enhanced Navigation","MR PDF Generation","Fast MR Validation","Dual-signature PDF MRs"],liveProjectUrl:"#",nextProjectUrl:"#"},2:{title:"A solution to improve Sleep quality on Colombian Women",badge:"UI/UX Design",template:"image-gallery",date:"March 2024",client:"Together Sleep Solutions",website:"together-sleep.com",websiteUrl:"#",description:"A comprehensive UX research and design project focused on improving sleep quality for Colombian women through a mobile application solution.\n\n1. Project Overview\n\nGoals:\nDevelop a culturally-sensitive mobile application that addresses the unique sleep challenges faced by Colombian women, incorporating local cultural factors, socioeconomic considerations, and behavioral patterns that affect sleep quality.\n\nRole: UX Researcher & Designer (conducted extensive user research, cultural analysis, and designed the complete user experience).\n\n2. Research Methodology\n\nUser Research: Conducted in-depth interviews with 200 Colombian women across different age groups, socioeconomic backgrounds, and geographic regions to understand their sleep patterns, challenges, and cultural factors affecting their rest.\n\nCultural Analysis: Studied Colombian cultural norms, family dynamics, work patterns, and social expectations that impact women's sleep schedules and quality.\n\nBehavioral Mapping: Analyzed daily routines, stress factors, and environmental conditions that contribute to sleep disruption among Colombian women.\n\n3. Key Findings & Insights\n\nCultural Factors: Extended family responsibilities and traditional gender roles often prioritize others' needs over personal sleep health.\nEnvironmental Challenges: Urban noise, housing conditions, and climate factors significantly impact sleep quality.\nSocioeconomic Impact: Work schedules, multiple job responsibilities, and financial stress create irregular sleep patterns.\nTechnology Adoption: High smartphone usage but limited exposure to sleep wellness apps designed for Latin American contexts.\n\n4. Design Solution\n\nCulturally-Adapted Interface: Designed with Colombian cultural context in mind, using familiar language patterns, imagery, and interaction models.\nPersonalized Sleep Plans: Created adaptive recommendations based on individual circumstances, family responsibilities, and work schedules.\nCommunity Features: Integrated social support elements that align with Colombian women's preference for community-based wellness approaches.\nPractical Tools: Included features for managing family schedules, stress reduction techniques adapted for Colombian contexts, and environmental optimization tips.\n\n5. Impact & Results\n\nUser Engagement: High adoption rates among test users, with 85% reporting improved sleep awareness.\nCultural Relevance: Positive feedback on culturally-sensitive design elements and locally-relevant content.\nBehavioral Change: 70% of users reported implementing at least 3 recommended sleep hygiene practices.\nCommunity Building: Strong user engagement with peer support and
